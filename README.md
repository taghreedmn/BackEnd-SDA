- Database: PostgreSQL 
- ORM: Entity Framework Core 
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication
- Hosting: Render and supabase 
- Version Control: Git (for source code management)


## Prerequisites :
- Vscode
- .Net 8 SDK
- SQL Server


  ## Getting Started :

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username//sda-3-online-Backend_Teamwork.git
```
Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.


 ### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Change your directory to the cloned repository:
```bash
cd sda-3-online-Backend_Teamwork
```
 ### Step 3: Set Up the Database
Create the Database:
Create a new database in your SQL Server or PostgreSQL instance. You can use SSMS or pgAdmin for this.
Note the database name, as you will need it in the next step.

Update Connection String:

Open the appsettings.json file located in the project root directory.
Update the connection string to point to your newly created database. For example:
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server;Database=your_database;User Id=your_username;Password=your_password;"
}
```
Replace your_server, your_database, your_username, and your_password with your actual database connection details.

 ### Step 4: Apply Migrations
To set up the database schema, you'll need to apply the migrations. In the terminal, run the following command:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```
This command will create the necessary tables in your database based on the entity definitions in the project.


 ### Step 5: Run the Application
You can now run the application. Use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
dotnet run
```
The application should start, and you will see output indicating that the server is running, typically on http://localhost:5005 or https://localhost:5125.

 ### Step 6: Testing the API
You can test the API using tools like Postman or cURL.
